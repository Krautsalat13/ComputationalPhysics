## Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [ising-model](./Ising-Model) | Simulates the 1D and 2D Ising model to study phase transitions in magnetic systems using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. |
| [molecular-dynamics](./Molecular-Dynamics) | Models particle motion and interactions using molecular dynamics. Results are compared for different numerical algorithms: Euler, Euler-Cromer, and Velocity-Verlet. |
| [electrodynamics-yee](./Electrodynamics) | Simulates 1D electromagnetic wave propagation using the Yee algorithm (FDTD). |
| [diffusion-equation](./Diffusion-Equation) | Solves the 1D diffusion equation using the second-order Product Formula approach. |
| [schrodinger-equation](./Schroedinger-Equation) | Solves the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation for: - **Particle Impinging on a Potential Barrier (Quantum Tunneling)**. - **1D Harmonic Oscillator**. - Uses the second-order Product Formula approach for time integration. |
