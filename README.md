## ðŸ§ª Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [ising-model](./Ising-Model) | Simulates the 2D Ising model to study phase transitions in magnetic systems. *(Add algorithm details here, e.g. Metropolis)* |
| [molecular-dynamics](./Molecular-Dynamics) | Models particle motion and interactions using molecular dynamics. *(Add force models and integration method)* |
| [electrodynamics-yee](./Electrodynamics) | Simulates 1D electromagnetic wave propagation using the Yee algorithm (FDTD). |
| [diffusion-equation](./Diffusion-Equation) | Solves the 1D diffusion equation using finite difference methods. *(Specify whether it's explicit/implicit)* |
| [schrodinger-equation](./Schroedinger-Equation) | Numerically solves the time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation in 1D potential wells. *(Mention method used, e.g. finite difference or shooting method)* |
